## About The Project

ðŸ¤– Spagorto

Spagorto started off as a little side project for my friends discord. The idea was simple, train a language model on random data to proved hilarious out of pocket responses. Over time, as development progressed, Spagorto evolved into a versatile Discord bot, incorporating a myriad of advanced features. The following highlights merely scratch the surface of its extensive capabilities. 

ðŸŽµ Music 

Beyond his linguistic prowess, Spagorto moonlights as your server's musical conductor. Use his API-powered music playback feature to orchestrate your favorite tunes or discover new beats seamlessly integrated into your gaming sessions.
